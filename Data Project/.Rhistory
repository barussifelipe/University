# 🧪 EXERCISE 1 — Simulated data ------------------------------------------
# Create a 3-variable dataset where all variables are highly correlated.
# Run PCA and plot PC1 vs PC2. Interpret.
#Simulate a 3D dataset.
x = rnorm(100, sd = 0.2)
y = 4 * x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.6)

geom_point(alpha = 0.5, col = "red")
#We can see that the range of values that PC1 involves is higher than PC2 and much higher than PC3, which
#supports the proportion of variance described in the summary.
# 🧪 EXERCISE 2 — Iris PCA ------------------------------------------------
# Use the iris dataset and compute PCA.
# Plot PC1 vs PC3 instead of PC1 vs PC2. Does separation improve?
iris_data <- iris[, 1:4]
iris_scaled <- scale(iris_data)
# Run PCA

geom_point(aes(x = PC1, y = PC3, col = "blue"),size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
labs(title = "PCA of Iris Dataset")
#Yes the separation improve.
# 🧪 EXERCISE 3 — Variance explained --------------------------------------
# Compute the proportion of variance explained by each component.
# How many PCs are needed to explain at least 90% of the variance?
var_explained_iris = pca_iris$sdev**2/sum(pca_iris$sdev**2)
#We need at least 2 PCS, PC1 and PC2 to explain at least 90% of the variance.
# 🧪 EXERCISE 4 — Visualize structure -------------------------------------
# Use the `fviz_pca_ind()` function (from factoextra) to show clustering by species.
fviz_pca_ind(pca_iris, repel = TRUE, col.ind = pca_df$Species)
# 🧪 EXERCISE 5 — Standardization test ------------------------------------
# Run PCA on unscaled iris data. Compare results with the scaled version.
# Why is scaling important?
non_scaled_iris = prcomp(iris_data, center = TRUE)
scaled_iris = prcomp(iris_data, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

#Scaling is important in order for us to really understand correctly which principal component explain
